I've been using Todoist for nearly two years now. This is the closet I've been to organising my work and personal life. Somehow, I'm able to add items, and mark them complete with Todoist. Something I never could with many other alternatives.

But I know I need more. Todoist is helping me survive, but I'd like to do more, track more, and do better at managing work, personal work, and life in general. 

This got me thinking about why virtually NO app, or service today meets my expectations. And I see this is a common opinion.

If I break down the essence of a Todo app, it has three functions  
1. listing down the things I need to do
2. helping me focus on one item, and complete it
3. keeping me accountable when I don't complete a task

There are unique challenges in each of these functions, which is probably the motivation for so many Todo apps existing today, and still more coming up in the future.

##### listing down the things I need to do

Challenges
- I need to be able to sort/organise the list of things well
- I need to be able to reflect the way I organise my thoughts in the Todo list, and this is the biggest disconnect
- Manging repetitive tasks and due dates for tasks
